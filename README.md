We are delighted to introduce our group project, our aim is to drive social change in our community.
This project is presented in qualification of the Development Software (DSW02A1) module.

Education has been a drive for social change in the economic and political development.
Education is a basic need for everyone no matter the race, religion, culture, tribe, etc.

For that reason, our government particularly has taken the initiative to fund its youthâ€™s education.
This great initiative has especially helped many people from disadvantaged backgrounds. As we are
are currently faced with a pandemic, our economy faced a great disadvantage and suffered a huge loss. As a result, the education funding budget could not accommodate new students who wish to apply for funding.
As the reality can be very difficult for everyone to adjust to, especially the disadvantaged, we believe us as the community can also contribute to keep the governments initiative alive by supporting and contributing towards a bursary or trust fund for youth education. We, the community, can tackle the problem and provide funds for a student in need.
In response to the social problem that many students face here in South Africa, we are building a crowdfunding website that matches individual funders, charities and other potential organizations with students. This could help a student get funded for their tertiary education. The platform can host challenges or intellectual games, where students will participate in order to receive funding for their education or other social needs. This will help to reduce the gap in education, drive social development as well as social engagement. We call the platform "crowdstudent".
