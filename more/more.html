			<h1>MORE ON FUNDER</h1>
			<p>
				Hey guys, hope you’re safe
				I just wanted to propose something about the front end part As we have to create 3 login forms and 3 dashboards:
				- we can have a home page which has a dropdpwn login button that contains 3 options(user, admin, funder) if for example the user wants to login they can select user option in the dropdown button then It directs them to the user login form and the same with admin and funder
				- the dashboard we can use bootstrap.
